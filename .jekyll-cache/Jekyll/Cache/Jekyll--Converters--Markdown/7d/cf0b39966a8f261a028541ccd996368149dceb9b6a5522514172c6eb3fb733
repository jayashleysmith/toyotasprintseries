<p>The championship is open to vehicles originally manufactured and/or originally sold by Toyota and
Lexus, as well as the Subaru BRZ and Scion FRS.</p>

<h4 id="class-overview">Class Overview</h4>
<p>Within the Toyota Sprint Series we run many different classes to ensure close competition.
Pro Tuner - Tuner or heavily sponsored entry where driver or car is at a professional level
A1 - Over 1600cc - forced induction with larger than standard turbo frame
A2 - Over 1600c forced induction - standard turbo frame.
A3 - Over 1600cc - forced induction - standard turbo frame - standard ecu
B - Up to 1600cc Forced Induction
C - Over 1600cc Normally Aspirated
D - Up to 1600 cc Normally Aspirated
E - Up to 1350cc Normally Aspirated
G - Diesel
J - Up to 1000cc Normally Aspirated
N2 - GT86 - Standard Car - Michelin Primacy Tyre
N1 - GT86 - Normally Aspirated - Modified
F2 - GT86 - Forced Induction - Standard Engine
F1 - GT86 - Forced Induction - Modified Engine
With the exception of Pro Tuner, the classes are further split in to Street &amp; Pro classes. eg: C- Street
&amp; C - Pro.
Generally speaking a Street class car will have a full interior and a normal road tyre whereas a Pro
class car is a stripped out car with a semi slick tyre.
Street classes must conform to all applicable Street Class &amp; General Regs - see section S &amp; G
Pro classes must conform to all applicable Pro Class &amp; General Regs - see section P &amp; G
Please Note: Due to the varied nature of vehicles competing we also have a gentleman‚Äôs agreement
on class structure, and may well ask a competitor who is competing on or near a level with a higher
class to comply with the higher class ruling as to regards safety equipment. Eg: someone builds a
1599cc turbocharged starlet with 500bhp and sequential gearbox can run in B Pro, but will need to
comply with A1 Pro safety equipment.</p>

Entries
Event Entries for an event must be placed and paid in full by midnight on the Wednesday before
each event, any entries after that time will only be accepted at the organisers discretion.</p>
<h4 id="points-system">Points System</h4>
<p>The championship consists of 7 rounds. You are welcome to complete all 7 rounds but only your best
6 scores will count towards a final overall position.
Main points system Presuming 75 entrants‚Ä¶ Fastest overall 75 points, 2nd overall 74 points etc etc.
This way everyone who competes scores points. This system benefits everyone except class A1, as 
there is the real possibility to ‚Äústeal points‚Äù from other classes. E.g. a class A2 car beats a class A1, or
a class B Street car beats a class B pro car etc. It also encourages reliability over outright power.
It also gives an overall position for everyone at the end of the year; again this will be a benefit to the
lower capacity classes, or maybe an embarrassment to the higher capacity classes?
Points are to be awarded to the driver and not the car.
Cars can be changed throughout the season as long as the car is in the same class, points will still be
awarded.
Cars can be changed or upgraded through the season to a higher class and the driver will retain all
points scored.
If a car is downgraded then points will be frozen and driver starts afresh.
If less than 75 cars enter a round then the winner will still get 75 points, and second place 74 etc etc
In an event of a tie then the drivers highest overall placing will count, if tied then whoever got
highest place 1st will take the win.</p>
<h4 id="championship-awards">Championship Awards</h4>
<p>1st, 2nd, 3rd overall.
Class Awards - 1st in class, 2nd in class if there is a minimum of 3 competitors, or 3rd in class if more
than 5 competitors.
Championship awards will only be given out if the competitor has competed in at least 3 rounds.
Extra championship trophies. eg: Highest Front Wheel Drive, Highest NA etc .</p>
